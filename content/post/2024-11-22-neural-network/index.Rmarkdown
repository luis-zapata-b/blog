## Introduction

Machine learning is a transformative tool for modeling complex relationships in data. Neural networks, a class of machine learning models inspired by the human brain, are particularly adept at handling non-linear relationships. This post explores their application, focusing on tensors, neural networks, and their underlying theory.

## Tensors: The Backbone of Neural Networks

At the heart of neural networks lie **tensors**, multidimensional arrays that generalize matrices to higher dimensions. Tensors enable efficient representation and computation of data, which is critical in machine learning.

For example, consider the input tensor `x`, which could represent a dataset:

```{python}
x = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]  # A 2D tensor (matrix)
```

Tensors flow through the network, undergoing operations like matrix multiplication and activation functions, ultimately producing outputs.

## Neural Network Architecture

Neural networks consist of interconnected layers:
- **Input Layer**: Receives input data (e.g., tensors).
- **Hidden Layers**: Perform computations to extract features.
- **Output Layer**: Produces predictions.

### Example Model Configuration

In the project, we optimized parameters to improve model performance:

```{python}
batch_size = 100
epochs = 5
learning_rate = 0.01
hidden_size = 128
```

These hyperparameters balance training efficiency and model complexity.

## Training the Neural Network

Training involves feeding data through the network, computing errors (loss), and updating parameters to minimize this loss using **gradient descent**.

```{python}
for epoch in range(epochs):
    train_loop(train_loader, model, loss_fn, optimizer)
    f1, acc, pred, lab = test_loop(test_loader, model, loss_fn)
    print(f"Epoch {epoch + 1}: F1 Score: {f1}, Accuracy: {acc}")
```

The optimization process gradually improves the model's ability to generalize patterns in data.

## Visualizing Predictions

A histogram compares the model's predictions to true labels, illustrating its accuracy.

```{python}
plt.hist(pred, bins=10, alpha=0.5, label='Predictions')
plt.hist(lab, bins=10, alpha=0.5, label='Labels')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

This plot highlights areas where the model performs well or requires improvement.

## Conclusion

While neural networks offer unparalleled flexibility, they can be computationally demanding and require careful tuning. In this project:
- **Decision Trees** outperformed Neural Networks in accuracy (~0.99), showing that simpler models sometimes suffice.
- With further refinement, neural networks could potentially achieve better performance.

Neural networks remain powerful tools for tackling non-linear data, and their potential to improve with enhanced tuning and computational resources is immense.
